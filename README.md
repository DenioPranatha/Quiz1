What I do is make selection for a $color variable and make this variable as a class that decide the background-color. <br>
For the link to detail page, I use /{name} property and loop if any array's name is equal to $name. <br>
For the yield, I pretty much just yield from main to each page in content and title. <br>

The catalog's directory is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/product<br>
